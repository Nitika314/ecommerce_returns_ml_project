E-Commerce Product Returns Prediction

Overview

This project predicts whether an e-commerce order will be returned using machine learning. The objective is to identify high-risk orders early so businesses can reduce reverse logistics costs, operational waste, and fraud exposure.

This is a binary classification problem, where:

1 = Returned

0 = Not Returned


Why This Problem Matters

Product returns are expensive and disruptive. Missing a return is far more costly than flagging a non-return incorrectly.
For this reason, Recall is prioritized over Accuracy throughout model selection.

Dataset

File: ecommerce_returns_dataset.csv

Target: Return

Key Features:

Price

Previous_Returns

Customer_Tenure_Months

Order_Hour

Product_Category

Delivery_Speed


Approach (End-to-End Pipeline)

Missing numeric values handled using median imputation

Categorical features encoded using one-hot encoding

Stratified train–test split (75% / 25%)

Feature scaling applied post-split to avoid data leakage

Multiple models trained and evaluated using consistent metrics



Models Evaluated

Support Vector Machine (RBF)

Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors

Random Forest (class-weighted)

Model Performance (Sorted by Recall)
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score	ROC-AUC
Random Forest	0.986	0.983	0.976	0.980	0.996
SVM	0.919	0.906	0.848	0.876	0.971
Naive Bayes	0.829	0.763	0.712	0.736	0.904
KNN	0.848	0.830	0.688	0.753	0.895

Selected Model: Random Forest
Chosen due to the highest Recall, minimizing missed returns while maintaining strong precision.


Key Insights (Feature Importance)

Top drivers of product returns identified by the Random Forest model:

Price (47.2%)

Previous_Returns (20.5%)

Customer_Tenure_Months (9.6%)

Product_Category_Clothing (8.0%)

Delivery_Speed_SameDay (5.9%)


Interpretation:
Higher-priced items, customers with a return history, and fast-delivery clothing orders are significantly more likely to be returned.

Design Decisions

Recall prioritized over accuracy due to asymmetric business cost

Median imputation used to handle skewed price distributions

Class-weighted Random Forest used to handle imbalance

Feature importance analyzed to ensure interpretability, not just performance


Limitations & Next Steps

No cross-validated hyperparameter tuning

No cost-sensitive loss function

Static dataset assumption

No deployment or real-time inference pipeline

Future improvements would focus on cost-based optimization and probability calibration.

Tech Stack:
Python
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
scikit-learn

Final Note

This project demonstrates practical ML decision-making, not just model fitting.
Model choice, metrics, and trade-offs were driven by business impact, not leaderboard accuracy.
